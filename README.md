## H2 Project Title: Automated System for Interview Candidate Assessment and Salary Determination

### H3 Introduction:
The traditional method of interviewing candidates and determining their salary through face-to-face interviews has several drawbacks. It is time-consuming, prone to bias, and lacks objective data analysis. An automated system for candidate assessment and salary determination can help eliminate these problems.

### H3 Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can assess candidates' skills and qualifications and determine their salary based on objective data analysis. This system will provide a fair and unbiased evaluation of candidates and their skills, enabling organizations to make informed decisions on hiring and compensation.

### H3 Drawbacks of Traditional Face-to-Face Interview Process in Salary Determination:
