## Project Title: Automated System for Interview Candidate Assessment and Salary Determination

### Introduction:
The traditional method of interviewing candidates and determining their salary through face-to-face interviews has several drawbacks. It is time-consuming, prone to bias, and lacks objective data analysis. An automated system for candidate assessment and salary determination can help eliminate these problems.

### Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can assess candidates' skills and qualifications and determine their salary based on objective data analysis. This system will provide a fair and unbiased evaluation of candidates and their skills, enabling organizations to make informed decisions on hiring and compensation.

### Drawbacks of Traditional Face-to-Face Interview Process in Salary Determination:
The traditional face-to-face interview process has several drawbacks when it comes to determining a candidate's salary. Some of these drawbacks are:

### Subjectivity: The interviewers' biases can affect the candidate's evaluation and salary determination.

### Time-consuming: Conducting face-to-face interviews for every candidate is a time-consuming process.

### Lack of data: The evaluation is subjective, and there is no objective data to support the decision.

### Inconsistency: The evaluation criteria may not be consistent across different interviewers.

### Advantages of the Automated System over Competitors:
The automated system has several advantages over its competitors, some of which are:

Objective data analysis: The system uses data to evaluate the candidate's skills and qualifications, eliminating subjectivity.

### Time-saving: The system can evaluate candidates quickly, reducing the time required for the evaluation process.

### Consistency: The system uses consistent evaluation criteria, ensuring that all candidates are evaluated fairly.

### Elimination of Bias: The system's objective evaluation eliminates any biases that may exist in the face-to-face interview process.

### Accurate Salary Determination: The system uses objective data analysis to determine a candidate's salary, ensuring that it is fair and consistent with industry standards.
